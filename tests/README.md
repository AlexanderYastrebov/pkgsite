# Tests

The tests directory contains integration tests that require a pre-seeded
database.

Each tests/<group> contains a seed.txt file at tests/<group>/seed.txt, which is
used by the docker seeddb container to setup the test database.

The tests can be run using tests/<group>/run.sh.

## Search Tests

The tests/search/scripts directory contains test scripts \*.txt that are run
using tests/search/run.sh.

These scripts follow the format:

```
Test name A
search query A
Expected result A1
Expected result A2

Test name B
search query B
Expected result B1
Expected result B2

...
```

Each test set is separated by a newline. Comments (lines that being with a #),
are ignored.

The imported by counts for a dataset can also be updated in
search/importedby.txt. The file has the format:

```
<package-path>, <imported-by-count>
```

It is expected that the modules for these packages are in
tests/search/seed.txt.

## Symbol History API Tests

The tests/api/scripts directory contains tests that are run
using tests/api/run.sh.

The tests compare API data for a module `tests/api/testdata` with the API
history on the frontend versions page. The frontend that is used for comparison
must have `GO_DISCOVERY_SERVE_STATS` set so that the
`/<path>?tab=versions&content=json` endpoint is available.

### Adding a package

Data in `tests/api/testdata` is generated by running:

```
go run tests/api/main.go generate [module path]:[package path suffix]
```

For example, `go run tests/api/main.go generate github.com/julieqiu/api-demo:pkg` for package
`github.com/julieqiu/api-demo/pkg`.

This data can now be used to check the API history on a frontend by running:

```
go run tests/api/main.go compare [module path]:[package path suffix]
```

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Th e2e/ directory contains end-to-end tests for pages on pkg.go.dev, which can
be run using `./tests/e2e/run.sh`.

### Running E2E Tests

In order to run the tests, run this command from the root of the repository:

```
./tests/e2e/run.sh
```

To run a set of tests with a custom experiment set active create a directory
with a config.yaml file and a seed.txt file if a custom set of seed modules
is desired. Then run `./tests/e2e/run.sh <directory>`.

`./tests/e2e/run.sh` sets up a series of docker containers that run a postgres
database, frontend, and headless chrome, and runs the e2e tests using headless
chrome.

Alternatively, you can run the tests against a website that is already running.

First run headless chrome:

    docker run --rm -e "CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=-1" -p 3000:3000 browserless/chrome:1.46-chrome-stable

Then run the tests from the root of pkgsite:

    ./all.bash npx jest [files]

`PKGSITE_URL` can https://pkg.go.dev, or http://localhost:8080 if you have a
local instance for the frontend running.

### Understanding Test Failures

If the tests failure, diffs will be created that show the cause of the failure.
Timeouts and diff thresholds are configurable for image snapshots if
adjustments are needed to prevent test flakiness. See the
[API](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot#%EF%B8%8F-api) for
jest image snapshots for more information.

### Writing E2E Tests

Tests are written in the Jest framework using Puppeteer to drive a headless
instance of Chrome.

Familiarize yourself with the
[Page](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v5.5.0&show=api-class-page)
class from the Puppeteer documenation. You'll find methods on this class that
let you to interact with the page.

Most tests will follow a similar structure but for details on the Jest
framework and the various hooks and assertions see the
[API](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api).
